### About Camas Band:
If you play an instrument (or are willing to learn one) and enjoy making music, you should join band! Band is a great opportunity to learn and progress as a musician, as well as build relationships with people who share similar passions. Band is made up of various wind, brass, and percussion instruments. Band is taken as an elective class during the school day for either 4th period (symphonic band) or 5th period (concert band). Jazz Band (0 period), Wind Ensemble (A lunch), and Pit Orchestra (after/before school) are also available by audition, and take place outside the regular school day.



#### What performances does the band play at?
- **Concerts:** The band plays at a Holiday concert, Winter concert, Spring concert, and Year-end concert. Jazz Bands also play at a separate Jazz Band concert. 
- **Football games:** The band performs half-times shows on the field as well as pre- and post-game shows in the stands.
- **Basketball and volleyball games:** During their respective seasons, the band plays pep music at home volleyball and basketball games.
- **Parades:** The band marches in several parades during the holiday season and in the spring. 
- **Disneyland/Disneyworld:** Every other year, the band goes on tour to either Disneyland or Disneyworld during spring break. (In 2019, the band will be going to Disneyworld)
- **Graduation:** Each year, the band plays for graduation (except, of course, the seniors who are graduating).
- **Musical:** Pit Orcherstra plays for the school's musical each year.


#### What kind of time commitment does band require?
During marching season, in addition to attendance at football/other sports games and parades, there are field show practices after school, band camp held for a week during the summer, and sectionals after school run by the section leaders for each instrument. Although practice calendars or logs are not assigned, throughout the school year individual practice is often needed in order to learn and perform the songs well. 


#### Is band better than choir?
Yes, without a doubt. Band is far superior. (We even sing sometimes)


#### How can I join band?
To join band, you need to need to forecast for it in your schedule. You also need to get the signature of Mr. Mancini (the band director).
